<speak><p>Hey</p> <p>how are you?</p>
Do you know what year we have now?</speak>

//Line 2
<speak><p>Yes</p> <p>but it is so only here and now.</p>
<p>Time and space are relative.</p>
<p>They are part of a four-dimensional space-time.</p> You will learn more about this.
</speak>

//Line3
<speak><p>To help us to learn</p> <p> I invited them here</p>
Professor Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton have a never-ending debate about Relativity, Quantum Mechanics and the essence of the Reality.   
</speak>

//Line4
<speak><p>As you perhaps know</p> it was Newton and Einstein that came up with all the laws that govern the universe.
<p>Welcome Professor Albert Einstein.</p>    
</speak>

//Line5
<speak><p>Welcome Sir Isaac Newton.</p>    
</speak>

//Line6
<speak><p>and basic quantum mechanics!</p>    
</speak>

//Line7
<speak><p>That will do! Sir Newton</p> calm down. <p>And Einstein</p> you know as well as I that Sir Newton was not born at the time that your generation developed Relativity Theory and Quantum Mechanics. Therefore he could not know them. <p>As for you, Sir Newton</p> please understand that you lived in an era at which time the science and technology were very limited, and so you do not have the complete picture of how the universe works 
</speak>

//Line8
<speak><p>No</p> we don’t mean to tell you.<p> Your laws work perfectly if you’re working with a certain size.</p> 
<p>But</p> when you look at things in the subatomic level, then that’s a different story. 
You see in the years after you died,<p>we discovered that it actually is possible to break down the atom-</p> 
</speak>

//Line9
<speak><p>The atom is the smallest particle that can exist by itself.</p> It is so small that earlier philosophers thought that it was indestructible- 
</speak>

//Line 10
<speak><p>It is enough that science managed to do this.</p> Atom is not in fact, indestructible. Now…
